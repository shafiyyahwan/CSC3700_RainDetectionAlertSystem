# Rain Alert and Detection System for Laundry

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This is an Arduino-based project developed as part of the **CSC3700 Embedded System Development** course.  
The system uses various hardware components to detect rainfall, record accurate timestamps, and store data for later analysis.

## âœ¨ Features
Real-time rain detection using a rain sensor
Accurate timestamping with the RTC DS3231 module
Automatic control of a servo motor to protect laundry during rain
Alert system using LED and buzzer
Event logging in EEPROM
Calculation of rain duration (start time, stop time, total duration)
Data retrieval for analysis

## ðŸ›  Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- RTC DS3231 (Real-Time Clock)
- Rain Sensor Module
- Servo Motor
- LED Indicator
- Buzzer
- EEPROM (built-in on Arduino Uno)
